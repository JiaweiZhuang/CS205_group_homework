CUDA and OpenACC codes for homework2

====================================
Brief Indroduction to Amazon Web Service (AWS)
====================================

We use AWS-EC2 to test GPU parallelization because Odyssey is too crowded.

1) For AWS beginners, see
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/

2) We recommend to use the spot-instance to reduce the cost, see
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/spot-and-science/

It can be 90% cheaper than the standard on-demand instance.
The cheapest GPU (p2.xlarge) typically cost ~$0.1/hour

Note that the Amazon Linux AMI prohibits x11 forwarding. You can use
$git status -v
as an alternative to gitk

====================================
Environment Setup for CUDA
====================================

There is already an official AMI with CUDA installed:
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LZMLK1K

1) Go to EC2 console, click "launch instance" (or using spot)
2) Click "AWS Marketplace"
3) Search for "NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit"
4) Select the instance type and launch. Note that it only allows 
"GPU instances" or "GPU computing" instance types.

For convenience, I also rememmend to add the nvcc compiler to the PATH:
$export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin":$PATH

====================================
Environment Setup for OpenACC
====================================

See http://www.pgroup.com/products/community.htm
for installing for PGI compiler.

Here I extract the basic steps from the documentation:

1) Download the package
2) $sudo ./install
3) Answer yes to all questions.
4) Say you choose to install in pgi_path/, 
set up the environment variables after installation:
$export PGI=pgi_path
$export PATH=$PGI/linux86-64/16.10/bin:$PATH
$export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$PGI/linux86-64/16.10/man
$export LM_LICENSE_FILE=$LM_LICENSE_FILE:$PGI/license.dat
(the version name might differ)

====================================
Running the CUDA code
====================================

Run P3_CUDA/compile*.sh and run the generated executable 

====================================
Running the OpenACC code
====================================

Run P*_OpenACC/compile*.sh and run the generated executable

To run on host, set:
$export ACC_DEVICE_TYPE=host

To run on GPU, set:
$export ACC_DEVICE_TYPE=nvidia
