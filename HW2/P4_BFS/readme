1) compile the code 
$./compile.sh
2) time and run the code
$./run.sh
see the 'real time'

-----previous intruction----
Edge list: sample.txt N = 7 
Edge list: rmat_scale.txt N = 2^scale
Example to run: ./BSF 7 sample.txt

To generate RMAT graph, run graph500 in matlab. Tune SCALE and edgefactor.
SCALE determine the size of vertex: 2^SCALE
edgefactor is the average number of edge associated with each vertex.
