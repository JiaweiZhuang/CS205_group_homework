C++ codes for homework 1

For unknown reasons, the C++ version yields better scalability than the
cython version (where we cannot see speed-up with more than 8 threads) 

====================================
How to run the code
====================================

1) On Mac:

Install gcc5 to support openmp
brew install gcc5

set it as the default compiler 
alias g++="g++-5"

Go to any of the sub-directories, for example:
$cd P3A_code 

Compile the C++ code:
$./compile.sh

Run the executable. for example:
$./vector_sum.out

To change the number of threads, for example, to 4:
$export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

To run the program multiple times with different numbers of threads:
$./test_multithread.sh

2) On Odyssey:

Ensure gcc5 or newer:
$module load gcc/5.2.0-fasrc02

go to the interactive mode like the cython tests

Then, all the same as on the PC.
