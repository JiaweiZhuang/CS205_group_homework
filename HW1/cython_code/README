cython codes for homework 1

====================================
How to run the code
====================================

1) On Mac:

Go to any of the sub-directories, for example: 
$cd P3A_code 

Then, build the cython module:
$./compile.sh

If no error occurs, you can run the program:
$python run.py

To change the number of threads, for example, to 4:
$export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

To run the program multiple times with different numbers of threads:
$./test_multithread.sh

To modify the test case (problem size, initial conditions...):
modify run.py

To clean the cython builds (not necessary in most of the time) 
$./clean.sh

2) On Odyssey:

I recommend to use the interactive mode instead of sbatch. For example:
$srun -p general --pty --x11=first --mem-per-cpu=3000 -N 1 -c 64 -t 00-01:00 /bin/bash
(It is likely to keep pending forever...)

Then it is all the same as on the PC.

====================================
Notes
====================================
1) *.c files (as one of the intermediate products of cython) are 
ignored in this cython_code/ directory. To add pure-C codes, put
them in another directories.
